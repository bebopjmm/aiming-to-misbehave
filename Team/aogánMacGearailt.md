## Character Summary
Lady Luck always seemed to favor Aogán. Raised by a father who was a small time confidence man kept the two on the move growing up. Aogán developed a penchant for cards as a child and after a major blowup with his father, he left out on his own where gambling provided for a comfortable lifestyle for seven years. Then a high stakes game went terribly bad. Aogán was lucky to escape with his life, but spent most of the next three years in a drugged and alcoholic stupor. A good friend helped Aogán finally get clean. Revenge on his mind, Aogán became a bounty hunter looking to capture or kill those responsible for that fateful night.
