## Exploits
**Mindless**: Androids are immune to any attacks which target MENTAL DEFENSE. 
**Deterministic**: An Androids’s PSI or LUCK attributes can never rise above zero. 
**Electronic vulnerability**: As mechanoids, Androids are vulnerable (1d6) to electricity damage, and vulnerable (2d6) to ion damage. 
**Automaton**: Androids do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and weigh 150% normal. Note that repairing damage to an android uses the engineering skill, not the medicine skill. 
**Access ports**: Viola can “plug in” to a computer or computerized system, granting her a +1d6 bonus to computer checks. 
**Aim**: Viola gains +1d6 to a subsequent ranged attack in the same turn by spending an action aiming.
**System override**: You remotely access another ship’s control computer, and briefly take a system offline with a LOG vs E-DEFENCE attack. One shield facing, or one weapon, can be deactivated until the beginning of the target ship’s next turn, at which point it is automatically reactivated. 
**Unsuspicious**: Everybody trusts a service droid; it doesn’t even occur to them that one might lie or attack. Viola gain a +1d6 bonus to all attempts to bluff or deceive or to access an ambush turn. 
**Upgrade**: Viola can modify a piece of electronic equipment of size Small or smaller to upgrade it permanently to a high quality item. This process takes one hour, but the item can only be used by you due to unfamiliar and jury-rigged controls, and renders it monetarily worthless. 
**Jury-rig**: Viola can temporarily repair and jury-rig a broken item of size Medium or smaller by spending five minutes with it. The item will operate for a number of minutes equal to your LOG check. If you spend one hour with it, it will operate for a number of hours equal to your LOG check. If you spend a day with it, it will operate for a number of days equal to your LOG check. 
**Scanner**: Viola has an inbuilt scanner (equal to a hand scanner) which it is always considered to be carrying. This scanner is visible and part of the sensory equipment. 
**Bachelor**. After a four-year course, Viola gained a Bachelor's degree with honors at university, improving his skill ranks in his chosen subject of nanotechnology to 3 (already factored, above). Her research skills are developed. If she has access to a library or data network, she gains a +1d6 bonus to attempts to learn information about a subject.
