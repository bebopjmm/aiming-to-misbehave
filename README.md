# aiming-to-misbehave
Aiming to Misbehave is a WOIN rpg campaign set in my custom Star Frontiers setting. This will be a CINEMATIC campaign heavily inspired by Firefly and Cowboy Bebop. 

## Group Concept
The crew of a small freighter are independent contractors striving to maintain their independence from the various corporate cartels, crime syndicates, and governmental organizations.
